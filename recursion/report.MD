Iteration can be much more time efficient than recursion, as in the given to problems. This is due to the recusive method keeps calling iteself so in Fibannochii for each number its recomputing from 0 vs iterative which computes each number once, saves the answer, and adds next computation to that one. It never recomputes same number twice. Therefor iterative is O(n) while recursive is exponential O(n^2).
